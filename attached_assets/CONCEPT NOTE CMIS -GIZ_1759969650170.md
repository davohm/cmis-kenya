STATE DEPARTMENT FOR CO-OPERATIVES


CONCEPT NOTE FOR THE DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE COOPERATIVE SECTOR THROUGH INSTALLATION & INTEGRATION OF ELECTRONIC DATA MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (EDMS) AND UPGRADE OF THE COOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (CMIS) 

Back ground 
The State Department for Cooperatives has been implementing the Cooperative Management Information System (CMIS) project as part of e-Government initiative to improve service delivery. The CMIS is meant to enhance the State Department’s capacity to monitor the performance of cooperatives by enabling a data driven and smart decision making and policy, regulation, and management environment, enforce good corporate governance, evaluate development programmes and improve information flows from cooperative societies through county offices to SDC headquarters and vice versa. The system envisages the automation of the core functions and processes of the State department as well as digitization of the sector records and data under the Commissioner for cooperatives office who is the Registrar for cooperatives under the cooperatives Act.
Problem Statement
The cooperative sector is currently serving over 14 million Citizens with an asset base of over two (2) trillion. The sector needs to have a data driven smart technology initiatives to ensure continuous growth and secure members investments through policy and regulation. The State Department for co-operatives in line with the e-government policy is implementing CMIS to digitize records and start providing services online to improve service delivery to the citizens and co-operatives in Kenya.
Relevance of the Project Idea
The Co-operative Management Information System (CMIS) is part of e-Government initiative to improve service delivery to the citizens and co-operatives in Kenya. Thus, CMIS is meant to enhance the State Department’s capacity to monitor the performance of co-operatives, enforce good corporate governance, evaluate development programmes and improve information flows from co-operative societies through county offices to SDC and vice versa. Specifically, the system will provide the following online services: - Registration of co-operatives, name searches, official searches, filing of annual returns, registration of charges, approval of maximum borrowing powers for co-operatives, registration of co-operative auditors and registration of co-operative audits amongst other services. These services will also be available at the Huduma centers where we will have cooperative services desks.
Scope of the project
The project establishes a mechanism for automating government services to co-operative institutions and other users. The project outputs will include system design, developing appropriate software and acquisition and installation of automation equipment and infrastructure (hardware) to enable provision of electronic services by the State Department for Cooperatives.
The system risks include hacking by fraudsters, maintaining integrity of information, fire and floods. These risks will be mitigated by access controls and business continuity planning including disaster recovery system. The project is being implemented at SDC Head-quarters at NSSF Building.
Goal
To improve service delivery to the citizens and co-operatives in Kenya.
Project Objectives/Outcomes
To enhance service delivery to citizens at both National and County levels.
Enhance the State Department’s capacity to monitor the performance of Co-operatives.
Improve good corporate governance and accountability.
Provide services online including through Huduma Centre platforms 
Proposed Project Outputs
Bulk filer for proper storage of historical data files acquired.
Server to host the MIS system acquired and installed.
SDC services available online.
The project is divided into various  stages and milestones as below; -
Stage one: An overhaul and upgrade of the CMIS Design, database, and software development.
Stage two: Setup and configuration of the system modules automating the core functions for online registration of cooperatives by the public, Enabling the registration of cooperative auditors and submission of audited accounts by cooperatives online, reporting module, USSD & Bulk SMS, Helpdesk and contact desk interactive modules, electronic data Management 
Stage three: Disaster recovery, secondary offsite back up, cloud back up aligning to the data protection act and data commissioner guidelines, back internet link; data migration and capacity building at both headquarters and the 47 counties.
Stage four: Capacity building of counties and sub-counties, data validation 
Stage five: Conducting Nationwide Co-operative Sector Survey, Helpdesk, contact center, monitoring and evaluation of system implementation in the counties and sub-counties.
Stage six: Establishment of online cooperative data resource centre, training of co-operatives on data driven automation, system maintenance.
Stage seven: Training of co-operatives and county co-operative staff, Develop and Establish an MOU with the council of Governors on data collection and system mainstreaming to the county cooperative operations capacity building Huduma Centers for roll out of the system to Huduma centres, system maintenance, monitoring and evaluation.
Key activities:
a) Upgrade of Design and software of the CMIS system
b) Implementation of Electronic data management system and digitization of cooperative records
c) Disaster recovery , secondary back up, cloud hosting
d) Capacity building of ICT, support desk and contact centre staff 
e) Redundant Internet capacity
f) Data migration
g) Capacity building of users at SDC, counties and Huduma Centers
h) Co-operative sector study
i) Improvement of Local Area Network
k) Establishment of cooperative smart data resource centre 
l) Monitoring and evaluation
Monitoring and Evaluation
A monitoring and evaluation mechanism will be mainstreamed in the project through;
•	Communication plan
•	Work breakdown structure
•	Milestones
•	Joint meetings
•	Carry out monitoring and evaluation as per workplan.
Implementation status reports
Risk and Mitigation Measures
The following risks are anticipated.
•	Budget may not be provided as planned
•	Resistance of users to change
•	Staff may not have adequate capacity to operate the system
•	Cyber security
•	Poor access to internet services
•	Inadequate legal framework to support the system
•	Mitigation measures will be developed to address these risks during design and software development.
•	Capacity building and awareness creation will be done for the co-operative movement to embrace the system.

Project Sustainability
The database for the system will be hosted at the SDC offices at NSSF Building with a cloud-based backup. A second backup and recovery center for the system will be set up away from the NSSF Building. A service level agreement between SDC and system developer will be developed to guarantee system continuity with provision for penalties in case of any security breach.
•	Operations and maintenance facilitation (availability of recurrent funding for redundant internet subscription and SMS notification service charges)
•	Replacement of ICT equipment, 
•	Upgrading of ICT infrastructure, 
•	Capacity building of users and system administrators 
•	Awareness creation
•	Cost sharing through users of the system meeting their own cost of internet services
•	County governments will be encouraged to procure ICT equipment for Sub County and county headquarter offices.
Project Readiness
•	Needs assessment done
•	Prospective system users sensitized
•	Benchmarking done
•	Project pilot is done

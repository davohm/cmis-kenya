FOR

AUTOMATION OF THE COOPERATIVE REGISTRY WITH AN AI POWERED ELECTRONIC DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (EDMS) AND UPGRADED RE-ENGINEERED CO-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (CMIS) AND SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE










							JULY 2022
 
Automation of the Cooperative Registry through an Upgraded & AI-Powered Cooperative Management Information System (CMIS) and Electronic Document Management System (EDMS)

Background

The core function of the State Department for Cooperatives is to oversee the development of economically viable cooperative societies through formulation and enforcement of policy as well as legal and regulatory framework that meet the aspirations of the cooperative movement. The State Department is taking measures to revitalize the cooperative sector through improved corporate governance to enhance service delivery to cooperative members. The use of manual systems and work processes makes it difficult for the State Department to effectively respond to the needs of stakeholders and achieve its mandate as required.

To address this problem, the State Department has developed an integrated Cooperative Management Information System (CMIS) to transform its systems from analogue to digital and services from manual to online.

1.	Introduction

The cooperative sector is one of the key pillars in Kenya’s socio-economic development, facilitating savings, investment, and grassroots economic empowerment. Despite this critical role, the sector continues to rely heavily on manual processes, paper records, and fragmented workflows, hindering effective governance, oversight, and citizen service delivery.

In response, and in alignment with the national e-Government strategy, the Digital Transformation Agenda, and the Data Protection Act, the State Department for Cooperatives is proposing the automation of the cooperative registry with an AI powered EDMS and an upgraded re-engineered modern, intelligent, and secure Cooperative Management Information System (CMIS) integrated with the necessary supporting infrastructure. This initiative is aimed at creating a seamless digital infrastructure to support end-to-end automation of the Cooperative sector  Registry and functions.

2.	Project Objectives

•	Digitize and automate all cooperative registry functions.
•	Enable secure, real-time access to cooperative data and services at both national and county levels.
•	Facilitate data-driven oversight, compliance enforcement, and policy formulation.
•	Improve transparency, reduce turnaround times, and eliminate manual bottlenecks.

3.	Key Components of the Proposed System
